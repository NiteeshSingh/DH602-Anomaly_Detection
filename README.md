# DH602-Anomaly_Detection

This is the repository for our Final Project of the course DH602-Machine Learning and Statistical Methods in Healthcare on the topic of "Universal Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Medical Imaging" where we worked on detection of anamolies in images our method is unsupervised as well as universal for the anamoly detection task.

this repo include files

*   data.py - for loading and handling input data
* ra.py  - reverse autoencoder model
* models.py -  our modified model structure
* losses.py - loss function used it contains both the original and modified loss functions

whereas the demo.ipynb files are used to run and train the model and get final results.
